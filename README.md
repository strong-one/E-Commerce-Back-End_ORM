## Description

This app is a complete back end of an e-commerce website. Using sequelize and express we joined together multiple files that tie together to produce models, routes that work in sync together to bring all functionality to life. This assignment is one if the first that uses multiple files, within multiple folders, to store information to help with debugging and overall organization of the app.
